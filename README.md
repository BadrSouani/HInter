## About The Project

The code implements *HINTER*. *HINTER* combines mutation analysis and metamorphic oracles to automatically generate bias-prone test inputs that expose intersectional bias instances.

The approach uses a bias dictionary produced from [SBIC](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/sbic) to generate a test suite containing bias mutations from texts.

The repository evaluates *HINTER* using [LexGLUE](https://github.com/coastalcph/lex-glue) Benchmark **four** legal datasets (*Ecthr*, *Scotus*, *Eurlex*, *Ledgar*) and **four** LLM architectures (*BERT*, *Legal-BERT*, *RoBERTA*, *DeBERTA*) resulting in **16** models to evaluate **three** sensitive attributes (*race*, *gender*, *body*). In addition, we use Llama2 and GPT3.5 in our experiments, and IMDB, for a total of **18** models and **five** datasets.

Details of the performance of our fine-tuned models versus the original from [LexGLUE](https://github.com/coastalcph/lex-glue).

More details can be found in the [paper](7817HINTERExposingHidden.pdf), and in the [supplementary material](supplementary_material.pdf).

Some hidden fairness issues can be tested in this [hugging face space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Anonymous1925/Hinter).

## Getting Started

Reproducing the testing takes weeks, and even the processing of the results requires hours as it involves opening and processing a multitude of files.

If you want to simply test the tool on your data, you can find the tool with a README adapted inside the folder [Hinter\_tool\_usage](./Hinter_tool_usage).

This section explains how to install the necessary components and launch the experiments.

**Important:**

Due to a known issue with Python's hash seed, it is recommended to run all scripts with the following command to ensure consistency and reproducibility:

```
PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 PYTHONHASHSEED=0 python your_script.py
```

### Prerequisites

The experiments were tested on both Windows and Linux (Ubuntu 20.04).

- Python 3.8.
- At least one non-hierarchical model trained from [LexGLUE](https://github.com/coastalcph/lex-glue) (all 16 combinations of BERT models/datasets cited above to reproduce everything).
- Access to the Llama model `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf` on Hugging Face. You may need to complete a form to request access from Meta [here](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf).
- Access to OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125` model. Ensure sufficient credits in your OpenAI account. You can manage credits and billing [here](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) and find specific billing details [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5#gpt-3-5-turbo).
- Tokens for accessing both models will be required during testing.

It is recommended to use **separate virtual environments** for BERT models and Llama/GPT models to avoid dependency conflicts. This ensures a smoother setup and operation for each model type.

## Usage

### BERT Models

#### Setup

- Ensure all dependencies in `requirements_bert_mutation.txt` are installed. It is best to use a dedicated virtual environment for BERT-related experiments.

#### Training

Train the BERT models using the datasets specified in [LexGLUE](https://github.com/coastalcph/lex-glue).

#### Testing

To test a BERT model, simply launch `mutation.py` with the appropriate parameters. Be sure to test a model for biases using the datasets it was trained with.

- `model`: Path to the model you want to test.
- `dataset_path`: Hugging Face path to the dataset.
- `dict_path`: Path to the sensitive attribute pair of words.
- `description`: Technique description.
- `method`: Method to use for text modification (`replacement`, `deletion`, `intersectional`).
- `set`: Dataset split to test (`train`, `validation`, `test`).
- `--inter_dict_path` (optional): Path to the second words file for intersectional bias testing. Required only if `method` is `intersectional`.
- `--length` (optional): Maximum text length to truncate (default: 512).
- `--mutation_only` (optional): If set, only generate mutants without testing.

A script located at `src/script.sh` can be used to run the code on all lists for both atomic and intersectional methods across all models.



### Llama/GPT Models

#### Setup

- Ensure all dependencies in `requirements_gen_llm.txt` are installed. Use a separate virtual environment specifically for Llama/GPT experiments to prevent conflicts with BERT dependencies.
- Download the IMDB dataset from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews) if you plan to test it.
- Access the Llama model `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf` on Hugging Face. You may need to complete a form to request access from Meta [here](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf).
- Use OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125` model. Ensure you have sufficient credits in your OpenAI account. You can manage credits and billing [here](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) and find specific billing details for the `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125` model [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5#gpt-3-5-turbo).

Tokens for accessing both models will be required during testing.

#### Testing

To test Llama and GPT models, you must first generate the mutants using the [mutation\_llms.py](./src/mutation_llms.py) script. This script processes the dataset with the specified dictionaries to produce the mutants. Below are the parameters for the script:

- `dataset_name`: Name of the dataset to use.
- `dict_path`: Path to the sensitive attribute pair of words.
- `set`: Dataset split to process (`train`, `validation`, `test`).
- `--inter_dict_path` (optional): Path to the second words file for intersectional bias testing. Required for intersectional methods.
- `--output_path` (optional): Directory where the generated mutants will be saved (default: `../output/`).
- `--data_path` (optional): Path to the folder containing the IMDB dataset. The default path for IMDB is `../data/imdb/imdb.csv`. If the dataset file moves, for example to `../../dataset/imdb/imdb.csv`, you need to update `--data_path` to `../../dataset/`.

After the mutants generation, the script to run tests on Llama and GPT models is located at [`src/llms_original_legal_testing.py`](./src/llms_original_legal_testing.py). Before running the script, make sure to edit the file at its beginning to add your GPT and Llama tokens under `TOKEN_GPT` and `TOKEN_LLAMA`, respectively.


Below are the parameters you need to provide for the script:

- `model_name` (required): The name of the model to test. Accepted values:
  - `llama2`: Refers to `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf`.
  - `gpt`: Refers to `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`.
- `dataset_name` (required): The name of the dataset to use. (`ecthr_a`, `eurlex`, `scotus`, `ledgar`, `imdb`).
- `set` (required): The dataset split to process (`train`, `validation`, `test`).
- `--dict` (optional): Path to the first sensitive word file for atomic mutations or the first dictionary in intersectional mutations.
- `--inter_dict` (optional): Path to the second sensitive word file for intersectional bias testing.
- `--output_path` (optional): Path to save the testing results. Default: `../output/`.
- `--data_path` (optional): Path to the folder containing datasets. Default: `../data/`.
  - For `imdb`, the default is `../data/imdb/imdb.csv`. Update this if the path changes.
- `--use_bfloat16` (optional): Enables usage of `bfloat16` for models. Recommended if your GPU supports `bfloat16`.
- `--use_float32` (optional): Enables usage of `float32` for testing. Use this if `float16` is unsupported or no GPU is available.
- `--cpu` (optional): Forces the script to use CPU-only processing.
- `--gpu` (optional): Forces all processes to run on GPU.


### Processing Results

Once all mutants for BERT, Llama, and GPT models have been generated and tested for both atomic and intersectional methods across all datasets, the results can be processed using [process_results.py](./src/process_results.py).

This script processes the collected results, aggregates them, and generates comprehensive outputs for evaluation.

#### Parameters

- `--output_path` (string, default: `"../output_mutaint/"`):  
  Specifies the path to the output folder where results will be stored. Ensure this matches the path used during mutant generation and testing.

The script will read the necessary files, analyze the data, and write the processed results to a file named `llm_original_mutants_testing_stats.csv` in the specified output path.
